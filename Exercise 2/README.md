# Exercise 2 – Image Processing & Frequency Domain Analysis

## Overview
Exercise 2 explores image processing techniques in Python using Google Colab:

- Downsampling & subsampling of images
- Convolution with custom filters (Sobel, box filter)
- Fourier transform & low-pass filtering

## Files
- `Exe2.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook with code and visualizations  
- `Example-256.png` – Input image.

## How to Run
1. Open `Exe2.ipynb` in Colab  
2. Mount Drive if needed:
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
